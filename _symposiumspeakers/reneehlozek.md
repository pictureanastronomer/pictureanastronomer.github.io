Talk title: "Could the dark matter be axions and why does it matter?"

Abstract: _Ultra-light axions are a promising dark matter candidate well motivated by high energy physics. While detection experiments hold great promise for axion detection, small-scale measurements from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a window into the dark sector that is not probed by detector experiments.  I will highlight current constraints from experiments like Planck and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and future forecasts on these fascinating dark matter candidates._
