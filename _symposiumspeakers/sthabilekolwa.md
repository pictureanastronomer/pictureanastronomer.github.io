Talk title: "Radio Telescopes - a pathway to astronomy development in Africa"

Abstract: _The SKA project has ushered in new and exciting opportunities for scientific discovery. Additionally, it has paved the way for tremendous development of astronomy in South Africa. Over the last decade, we have seen plenty of growth in the numbers of faculty, postdocs, and students involved directly in optical observing with SALT and radio astronomy with MeerKAT (an SKA pathfinder) which was commissioned in 2018. As a black South African and Zambian radio astronomer who has been involved with the SKA since undergrad, I have witnessed and been a part of these developments. In this talk, I will give a highlight reel of milestones for astronomy in S.A. I will also describe the impact they have had in growing astronomy as a field of study and scientific inquiry in S.A. and some other countries in the African continent. Amid the excitement of commissioning powerful telescopes, transforming the social and cultural landscape of astronomy is still a challenge. I will discuss how our colonial history, socio-economic barriers, and gender inequity can limit many from pursuing scientific careers in astronomy in Africa._
