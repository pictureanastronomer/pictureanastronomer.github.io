Talk title: "Searching for Satellites of LMC Analogs"

Abstract: _Low-mass dwarf galaxies with stellar masses less than a billion suns have provided some of the most stringent tests of the nature of dark matter on small scales. Large new samples of such galaxies are efficiently selected as satellites of Milky-Way mass galaxies. However, interesting new tests of the nature of dark matter and galaxy evolution are opened if we can chart the satellites systems of LMC analogs as well. I will present initial results from the first eight hosts in ELVES-Dwarf, which uses the surface brightness fluctuation technique to efficiently find galaxy groups around low-mass hosts._
