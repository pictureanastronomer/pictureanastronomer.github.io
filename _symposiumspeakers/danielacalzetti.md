Talk title: "Tracking and Understanding Star Formation in the Local Universe"

Abstract: _Our ability to trace star formation and the ensuing stellar feedback hinges on our ability to measure star formation rates with accuracy. This usually implies understanding how tracers may be affected by extraneous contributions, e.g., from older stellar populations non involved in the star formation. I will provide a short review of the current status of star formation rate tracers and how they reflect the complex multi-scale ecosystem of galaxies._
