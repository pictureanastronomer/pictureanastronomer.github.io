Talk title: "Galaxy Chemistry and You"

Abstract: _The chemistry of gas and stars in galaxies connects many seemingly disparate areas of astrophysics, from planet formation and stellar evolution to the enrichment and physical state of the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. Because heavy elements are the end product of converting gas to stars, the abundance and distribution of different elements in and around galaxies tells the story of how galaxies grow and change over time. Astronomers have been studying the chemistry of galaxies outside the Milky Way for well over 50 years, but only in the last decade have detailed studies of galaxy enrichment in the distant universe been possible. Using premier facilities like the Keck Telescopes and the James Webb Space Telescope, we have made significant advances in characterizing galaxies that were forming at early times---particularly during "Cosmic Noon," the period 8-12 Gyr ago when about half of all the stars in the universe were formed. I will discuss how innovative techniques for determining galaxy chemistry have helped to create a more nuanced picture of these young systems and allowed us to make connections between galaxies, their stellar populations, and their gaseous environments over cosmic time._
