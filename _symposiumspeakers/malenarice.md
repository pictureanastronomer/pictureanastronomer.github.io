Talk title: "Exoplanet Systems in 3D"

Abstract: _While thousands of exoplanets have been discovered to date, we are just beginning to scrape the surface of how their systems are constructed: how planetary orbits are oriented relative to each other and their host star, as well as how their dynamic histories can be deduced from these clues. I will discuss recent advances in examining exoplanet systems in 3D, focusing on the goal of understanding not only the properties of exoplanets themselves, but also how diverse planetary systems are globally structured. I will also share insights from my personal journey through academia as an exoplanet scientist and a woman._
