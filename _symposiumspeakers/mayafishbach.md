Talk title: "Gravitational waves from the stellar graveyard"

Abstract: _The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has observed ~100 gravitational-wave sources to date, including mergers between black holes, neutron stars, and mixed neutron star-black holes. These neutron stars and black holes connect many astrophysical puzzles, including the lives and deaths of stars, star cluster dynamics, cosmic chemical enrichment, and the expansion history of the Universe. I will describe some recent astrophysical lessons from gravitational-wave discoveries._
