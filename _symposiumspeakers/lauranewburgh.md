Talk title: "Cracking the Challenge of CHIME Calibration with Novel New Techniques"

Abstract: _Recent cosmological data sets have shown tantalizing hints that our current model of Dark Energy may be too naive. New experiments like CHIME are poised to address this question through 3-dimensional maps of structure using the 21cm emission line from neutral hydrogen contained in abundance in galaxies. However, success hinges on our ability to remove bright foreground emission, which requires improved calibration of the instrument. In this talk, I will highlight recent progress in calibration towards our ultimate goal of improved measurements of Dark Energy, and discuss future directions for the analysis._
