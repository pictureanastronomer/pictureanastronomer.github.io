Thanks to a generous grant from the University of Chicago Womenâ€™s Board, we are able to run a one-time series of events aimed at increasing representation for, and retention of, women in astrophysics. In partnership with the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago, programming will run from January - March 2025, with opportunities to participate/attend both in person and virtually, and recordings will made available after each event (linked here) to extend reach.

Details of our events, including registration and attendance information and recordings (post-event) are available here. We will be updating this website regularly in the run-up to these events, so do check back for more.
