#### Schedule

##### Monday
- **8:00-9:00am**: Coffee
- **9:00-9:25am**: Ava Polzin (Chicago) for the SOC
- **9:25-9:50am**: Shany Danieli (Tel Aviv) - "Dwarf Galaxies Beyond the Local Group"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		Low-mass (dwarf) galaxies are key to probing dark matter and galaxy formation on small scales but remain challenging to detect and study. Research has largely focused on Milky Way satellites, but advances in telescopes and imaging now enable studies beyond the Local Group. I will review obstacles to studying distant dwarfs, highlight discoveries revealing their remarkable diversity, and discuss size-mass outliers, dark matter variations, and globular cluster populations. I will conclude with ongoing and future surveys essential for mapping the broader dwarf galaxy population.

- **9:50-10:15am**: Jenny Greene (Princeton) - "Searching for Satellites of LMC Analogs"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		Low-mass dwarf galaxies with stellar masses less than a billion suns have provided some of the most stringent tests of the nature of dark matter on small scales. Large new samples of such galaxies are efficiently selected as satellites of Milky-Way mass galaxies. However, interesting new tests of the nature of dark matter and galaxy evolution are opened if we can chart the satellites systems of LMC analogs as well. I will present initial results from the first eight hosts in ELVES-Dwarf, which uses the surface brightness fluctuation technique to efficiently find galaxy groups around low-mass hosts.

- **10:15-10:40am**: Daniela Calzetti (UMass Amherst) - "Tracking and Understanding Star Formation in the Local Universe"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		Our ability to trace star formation and the ensuing stellar feedback hinges on our ability to measure star formation rates with accuracy. This usually implies understanding how tracers may be affected by extraneous contributions, e.g., from older stellar populations non involved in the star formation. I will provide a short review of the current status of star formation rate tracers and how they reflect the complex multi-scale ecosystem of galaxies.

- **10:40-11:00am**: Break
- **11:00-11:25am**: Allison Strom (Northwestern) - "Galaxy Chemistry and You"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		The chemistry of gas and stars in galaxies connects many seemingly disparate areas of astrophysics, from planet formation and stellar evolution to the enrichment and physical state of the circumgalactic and intergalactic media. Because heavy elements are the end product of converting gas to stars, the abundance and distribution of different elements in and around galaxies tells the story of how galaxies grow and change over time. Astronomers have been studying the chemistry of galaxies outside the Milky Way for well over 50 years, but only in the last decade have detailed studies of galaxy enrichment in the distant universe been possible. Using premier facilities like the Keck Telescopes and the James Webb Space Telescope, we have made significant advances in characterizing galaxies that were forming at early times---particularly during "Cosmic Noon," the period 8-12 Gyr ago when about half of all the stars in the universe were formed. I will discuss how innovative techniques for determining galaxy chemistry have helped to create a more nuanced picture of these young systems and allowed us to make connections between galaxies, their stellar populations, and their gaseous environments over cosmic time.

- **11:25-11:50am**: Kate Whitaker (UMass Amherst) - "Discovering Ancient Relics in a Distant Evolved Galaxy"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		Globular clusters are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe and thus hold clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly.  However,  accurate age measurements of ancient star clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. In this talk, I will share the discovery of a large population of globular cluster candidates within the 'Relic', a massive, evolved galaxy existing only 2.5 billion years after the Big Bang.  The Relic is a unique laboratory that enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift star clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of globular cluster evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.  Through personal anecdotes centered around being a woman, a mother, an astronomer, and a mentor, I will also weave into this story a few of my own lessons learned over the course of my career.

- **11:50-12:15pm**: Erica Nelson (CU Boulder) - "2 Fast, 2 Furious: The remarkable power of JWST to revolutionize our understanding of galaxy and black hole formation"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		The launch and commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope is ushering in a new era in our understanding of our cosmic origins. Galaxies are a fundamental building block of the universe, yet how they formed has remained enigmatic owing to our inability to observe them at early cosmic times. In just the first two and a half years of data, JWST has already upended our understanding of galaxy and black hole growth in the early universe. In this talk I will discuss some of the surprising results that have come out of our work with JWST and their impact on our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies. This includes remarkably mature galaxies at early times, galaxies so luminous they allow us to see much further back in time than we thought possible, overmassive black holes, bulges where we thought there were none, and a new method for measuring kinematics that has revealed a monstrous spinning disk 1 billion years after the big bang. Galaxy and black hole growth in the early universe appears to have happened much more rapidly than previously thought, defying predictions from theoretical models. Iâ€™ll conclude with a discussion of where the field is moving and the rich discovery space in this new era of extragalactic astrophysics.

- **12:15-1:15pm**: Lunch
- **1:15-1:40pm**: Katie Auchettl (Melbourne) - "The imprint of their explosions: Using supernova remnants to understand stellar death"
		<details>
		<summary> Abstract </summary>

		One of the most uncertain aspects related to our understanding of the end points of stellar evolution is the link between the progenitor star and the nature of the supernova explosion that the progenitor will undergo. Even though hundreds of supernovae are discovered each year by optical surveys, these sources are usually too distant to resolve the ejecta and immediate surrounding of the exploded star. However, due to their long lifetimes and close proximity, supernova remnants which are the long lived structures that result from the supernova explosion of either a white dwarf or a massive star, provide us with a unique opportunity to study supernova explosion and dynamics up close and in detail. In this talk, I will highlight some recent advances that have been made in the understanding of supernovae and their progenitors using multi-wavelength studies of supernovae and their remnants.

#### Suggested Resources
So that everyone is on the same page in discussions, here are some suggested materials, which are not specifically endorsed, but rather represent a portion of the extensive resources available. These documentaries/books/popular articles/refereed publications are not intended to be comprehensive, but instead offer a starting point to have data-driven, solution-oriented conversations. There are (social) scientists dedicated to understanding the science gender gap, so the larger literature is a key starting point for informed discussion. (If you would like to see something particular added, please let us know.)
