We will post a draft schedule later this week. Please check back soon. 


#### Travel and Accommodation

If you are booking travel and accommodation to Chicago, please refer to our [Logistics for In-person Attendance](https://pictureanastronomer.github.io/registration).


#### Suggested Resources
So that everyone is on the same page in discussions, here are some suggested materials. (Work in progress! If you would like to see something added, please let us know.)

- [Picture a Scientist](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/video/picture-a-scientist/){:target="_blank"} documetary (free options to view include the PBS transcript or access through your library -- Kanopy serves some University libraries)
- [The Sky is for Everyone](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691207100/the-sky-is-for-everyone?srsltid=AfmBOoqP1H9EcVnvSNwZ9MasOuizZFxhmYP9iRuxSGpypHEf9LBKltkP) edited by Virgina Trimble and David Weintraub
- [Blazing the Trail](https://www.amazon.com/Blazing-Trail-Essays-Leading-Science/dp/1482709430/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) edited by Emma Ideal and Rhiannon Meharchand

For undergraduates/early graduate students, we also recommend [Astronomy as a Field: A Guide for Aspiring Astrophysicists](https:/arxiv.org//abs/2312.04041), which was authored by, and contains advice from, a number of Picture an Astronomer speakers and attendees.
