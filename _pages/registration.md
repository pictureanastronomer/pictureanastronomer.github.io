#### Logistics for In-person Attendance

The University of Chicago is located in Chicago's South Side in the Hyde Park neighborhood. Most of the Picture an Astronomer events will be held at the William Eckhardt Research Center (5640 S. Ellis Ave.).

##### Getting to Hyde Park

The Metra Electric and South Shore commuter rail train lines run directly to Chicago's Hyde Park neighborhood from Millenium Station downtown, with trips taking 15-20 minutes. The closest stops to the University are 55th-56th-57th and 59th St. Tickets run $3.75 one way and can be purchased on the Ventra app, on the train (cash only), or at a ticketing kiosk at a station. (Train schedules and additional details are available [here](https://ridertools.metrarail.com/maps-schedules){:target="_blank"}.) Both stops are a \~20 minute walk from the Eckhardt Research Center.

The Chicago Transit Authority offers public transit options via the 'L' and buses -- details are available on the [CTA website](https://www.transitchicago.com/travel-information/){:target="_blank"}. CTA passes can be purchased at stations or in the Ventra app. Recently, the CTA has added support for contactless payment.

The University of Chicago is \~20 minutes south of the Loop by car depending on traffic.

If you are flying in, as for the symposium, Hyde Park is \~45 minutes from O'Hare International Airport (ORD) or \~25 minutes from Midway International Airport (MDW) driving. There is a direct Blue Line 'L' train from ORD to downtown Chicago, and the Orange Line goes from Midway to the Loop. Details are available on the [CTA website](https://www.transitchicago.com/airports/){:target="_blank"}.
