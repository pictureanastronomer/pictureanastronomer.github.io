Talk title: "The cosmic origins of the heaviest elements"

Abstract: _This talk explores the cosmic origins of the elements across the Period Table, including the heaviest elements in the universe such as gold and platinum, that are forged in the most extreme astrophysical environments. I will discuss the role of chemical enrichment in galaxies, how ancient stars serve as time capsules preserving the early history of element formation, and how observations with modern telescopes provide insights into the early phase of star and galaxy formation soon after the Big Bang. By studying the elemental signatures in the oldest stars, astronomers can thus piece together our cosmic history._
